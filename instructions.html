    <ul>
        <li><strong>Never Share Your Private Keys:</strong> Ensure you never share your private keys or any sensitive
            credentials with anyone. Your private keys provide access to your funds and should be kept secure at all
            times.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Hardcoding Credentials:</strong> Do not hardcode any sensitive information, such as private
            keys or passwords, directly into your codebase or documentation. This can lead to security vulnerabilities.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Use Wallet Providers Securely:</strong> When interacting with wallet providers like MetaMask, always
            ensure you are using the official version and verify the authenticity of any prompts or transactions before
            proceeding.</li>
